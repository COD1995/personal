I'm an **Instructor** at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the [University at Buffalo](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/graduate/courses/class-schedule.html), where I've led courses in Deep Learning and Pattern Recognition. Before my academic role, I was a **Machine Learning Engineer** at the National Lab of [Zhejiang University](http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/mathen/main.htm), specifically with the Zhejiang Society For Mathematical Medicine, where I developed a bone age detection system for a prominent hospital.

During my internships as a **Software Engineer** at Nanjing Ohappure Tech Co. Ltd, I undertook projects ranging from water quality database management to enhancing the company's website, which led to my recognition as the Best Intern in Summer 2017.

Academically, I'm pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at The State University of New York at Buffalo. I also earned my Master's in Robotics from the same institution and completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Wake Forest University.
