## Grading
The following is the outline of the grading: 
### Grading Components
We will have
- **Attendance:** 10 percent (Random Pop Quiz)
- **Programming Assignment:** 30 percent (2 PA)
- **Midterm:** 30 percent
- **Final:** 30 percent (Dec 14th)

### Grading Rubric
This course is **absolute grading**, meaning no curve, as there is a certain standard we need to uphold for students to have a good knowledge of deep learning.
