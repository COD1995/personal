  <h2>Course Overview</h2>
  <p>This course is intended for SEAS Engineering graduate students who are interested in understanding the fundamental issues, challenges, and techniques that are associated with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI). The course will discuss the history and properties of basic AI systems, including neural networks, machine learning, and data science, and how to build a basic machine learning and AI project, including data scrapping, data processing, etc. We will discuss the challenges of bias, security, privacy, explainability, ethical issues, and the use of context.</p>
  <p>We will learn about AI's use in applications such as image processing and computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and gaming. The course is supported by a primer on the use of Python to support homework and projects related to machine learning. The course will be a combination of lectures, discussions, activities, and projects that will prepare students without a computer science background to study and apply artificial intelligence tools and applications in a variety of different domains.</p>
  <p class="course-note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> The course is <strong>NOT</strong> intended for students who have a reasonable background in machine learning, computer science, or Python programming. Undergraduates who wish to take this course and petition for credit need to inquire with the <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/home/academics/grad/contact.html">SEAS graduate office</a>.

## Grading

The following is the outline of the grading: 

### Grading Components

As we progress with the course, students are **suggested** to spend weekends to finish the following course on freeCodeCamp: 

- [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)
- [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)
- [College Algebra with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/college-algebra-with-python/)

By finishing these courses and getting a certification will allow you to get a **15pts** bonus for this course. These courses are extremely easy and should help you warm up and not be afraid of coding.

We will have
- **Attendance:** 10 percent (Random Pop Quiz)
- **Programming Assignment:** 30 percent (2 PA)
- **Midterm:** 30 percent
- **Final:** 30 percent 

### Grading Rubric

The final grade will be determined based on the *overall performance* of the class, taking into consideration all relevant assessments and contributions. 
- The instructor reserves the right to make **final** decisions regarding grades. 
- Please note that excuses for missed work or poor performance, such as personal conflicts or minor inconveniences, will not be considered unless exceptional and documented circumstances arise.

### Note on Logistics
- A week-ahead notice for mid-term, based on the pace of the course. 
- The logistic is <span style="color:red;">subject to change</span> based on the overall pace and the performance of the class.
