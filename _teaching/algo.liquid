<div class="course-description-box">
  <p>
    Introduces basic elements of the design and analysis of algorithms. Topics include asymptotic notations and analysis,
    divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, fundamental graph algorithms, NP-completeness, and
    approximation algorithms.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each topic, besides in-depth coverage, we discuss one or more representative problems and their algorithms.
    In addition to the design and analysis of algorithms, students are expected to gain substantial discrete mathematics
    problem-solving skills essential for computer scientists and engineers.
  </p>
  <p class="course-note">
    <strong>Pre-requisite:</strong> You should have taken CSE250 (data structure) or similar courses before.
    We expect you to have certain levels of mathematical maturity:
    You should have basic understanding of calculus (e.g., limit, differentiation, integration) and linear algebra
    (e.g., matrix, vector space, linear transformation); You should be comfortable to read and write mathematical
    proofs, understanding common proof strategies (e.g., proof by induction, contradiction). We also expect you to have
    some programming experience: know what is a computer program, and be able to read and write code.

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>
<p>
  This course is <strong>absolute</strong> grading, meaning no curve, as there is a certain standard we need to uphold
  for students to have a good knowledge of deep learning.

<h2 id="lecture-notes">Lecture Notes</h2>
<p>
  The lecture notes are primarily based on the textbook
  <em>Algorithm Design and Applications, 1st Edition</em> by Michael T. Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia.
  While the book provides an excellent foundation, I have observed that students often face challenges
  understanding some derivations due to missing intermediate steps. To address this, I have expanded on
  these derivations and included detailed explanations to enhance clarity and comprehension.
</p>
<p>
  The lecture notes are continually updated, so please check back regularly for the latest versions and improvements.
