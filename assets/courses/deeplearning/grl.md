## Overview

Graph representation learning aims to create graph representation vectors that accurately capture the structure and features of large graphs, which is crucial for downstream tasks like *node classification, link prediction, and anomaly detection*. The field has seen significant growth, with methods divided into *traditional graph embedding techniques* and *graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches*. These techniques apply to both *static (fixed) and dynamic (evolving) graphs*. 

## Introduction

Graphs are powerful data structure (social networks, financial transactions and biological networks)
