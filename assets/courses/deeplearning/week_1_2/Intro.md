Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our daily lives, revolutionizing industries and transforming how we interact with technology. From voice assistants to recommendation systems and autonomous vehicles, AI is everywhere, driving innovation and solving complex problems. In this section, we introduce foundational concepts and mathematical preliminaries that form the backbone of modern AI systems. We will begin by exploring linear neural networks, one of the simplest yet most important building blocks of deep learning models, setting the stage for more advanced architectures and techniques in the field.

## AI is Ubiquitous
You may find the applications of AI in every aspect of our lives these days.
